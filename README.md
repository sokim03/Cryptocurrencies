# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview:
Accountability Accounting Advisory Services Team has asked to create a report including what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for customers. Using the unsupervised machine learning model, we grouped the cryptocurrencies on a clustering algorithm and used data visualizations to share our findings with the board.
